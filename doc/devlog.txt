INNER JOIN checks corresponding columns in two tables and for shared values (ID) and combines information from both tables at this row as an entry in a new table. Value (ID) must exist in both tables.
LEFT JOIN combines all the values (ID) from corresponding columns in two tables and aligns information in each row from both tables as an entry in a new table. Value (ID) may exist in one table but not in the other.
CROSS JOIN performs Cartesian multiplication on a given number of table columns to create a new table of unique entries which each contain unique combination of column values.
"Programming Sucks" has a humorous and satirical take on the most hair-pulling parts of programming. The author uses real life metaphors creatively to represent programming frustrations. Code will never be perfect!
